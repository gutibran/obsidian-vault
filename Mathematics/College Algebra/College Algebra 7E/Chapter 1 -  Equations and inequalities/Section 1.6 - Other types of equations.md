# Polynomial equations
This is when two polynomials are equal to each other.
The general form is if one side is 0 and the polynomial on the other side is descending powers of the variable. The degree of the entire equation is the highest degree of any term in the equation, takes into account both polynomials.

1. Move all terms to one side of the equation and the other side set to nothing which is 0.
2. Factor and solve for x
3. Substitute the solutions for x to verify it is correct.

# Radical equations
Any equation where a variable occurs in a root (square, cube, any higher root).
