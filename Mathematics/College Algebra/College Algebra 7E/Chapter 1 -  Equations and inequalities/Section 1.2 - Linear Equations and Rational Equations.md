A **linear equation** is an equation where the highest exponent is 1.

# Solving linear equations in one variable
This is the general form. $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $a \neq 0$.
$$
ax + b = 0
$$

Solving means to determine all the values of $x$ that make the equation true, the **solution set**. These values are referred to as **solutions** or **roots** of the equation. "Plug in" or substitute values for $x$. When a value makes the equation is true, it is said to **satisfy the equation**.

When two equations have the same solution set, they are **equivalent equations**.

## Generating equivalent equations
1. simplify the expression by removing grouping symbols with the distributive property and combining like terms.
2. add or subtract the same real number or variable expression on both sides of the equation
3. multiply or divide the same nonzero quantity on both sides of the equation
4. interchange the two sides of the equation, for aesthetics

## The difference between algebraic expressions and equations
Expressions are simplified and equations are solved. Simplified means to reduce to the fewest amount of terms possible. Solving means to find all the values that make the equation true.

## Solving steps
1. simplify the expression by removing grouping symbols with the distributive property and combining like terms.
2. collect all variable terms on one side and all the numbers, or constant terms on the other side
3. isolate the variable and solve
4. check the solution by substituting that value into the original equation.


# Linear equations with fractions
Multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD of the denominators of any fractions in the equation. Remember that the LCD is the smallest number that all denominators will divide into.

# Rational equations
These are equations that contain one or more rational expressions. Even if you solve and get an solution or solution, sometime the value is not a solution because it is equal to a value that is a restriction. Refer to prerequisite notes but the denominator cannot be zero because division by zero is undefined. We exclude all values that make them zero.


Really need to grasp and practice and understand the concept of cancelling out factors when dividing and multiplying fractions.

# Types of equations
Equations are placed into categories based on their solution sets. When the variable is eliminated the statement will be left.

## Identity
An equation that is true for all real numbers for which both sides are defined.

$$
x + 3 = x + 2 + 1
$$

## Conditional
Not an identity but is true for at least one real number.


For this example the equation is true if and only if $x$ is 7.
$$
2x + 3 = 17
$$
## Inconsistent
An equation that is not true for any real number. Results in an empty set or null set. Denoted by Phi $\phi$.

$$
x = x + 7
$$
