These are equations where the highest exponent is 2.

This is the general form. $a$, $b$, and $c$ are real numbers. $a \neq 0$. Also known as a **second degree polynomial equation in x**. 

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

# Solving quadratic equations by factoring

When you factor the nonzero side of the equation you can use the **zero-product princple** to solve. This just means to set each factor to zero (form its own equation) and solve accordingly. Check the solution by plugging it in.
$$
AB = 0, \text{ then } A = 0 \text{ or } B = 0
$$
1. Rewrite the equation in $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, move all nonzero terms to one side and 0 on the otherside
2. Factor completely
3. apply the zero product principle
4. solve equations in step 3
5. Check solutions in the og equation

# Solve quadratic equations by the square root property
Quadratic equations in the form $u^2 = d$. Where $u^2$ is an algebraic expression and $d$ is a nonzero real number.

Isolate $u^2$ on one side of the equation and $d$ on the other side. Take the square root of both sides. Two numbers whose square is $d$. A positive and a negative. Use factoring to verify.

$$
u^2 = d
$$

$$
u^2 = d = 0
$$

$$
(u + \sqrt{d})(u - \sqrt{d}) = 0
$$

$$
u + \sqrt{d} = 0 \text{ or } u - \sqrt{d} = 0
$$

$$
u = -\sqrt{d} \text{ and } u = \sqrt{d}
$$

1. isolate numbers and variables on their respective sides of the equal sign
2. square the number
3. profit
Use the plus/minus sign to denote two solutions

# Completing the square
Convert the equation into an equivalent equation that can be solved using the square root property. Add $(\frac{b}{2})^2$
$$
x^2 + bx + (\frac{b}{2})^2 = (x + \frac{b}{2})^2
$$

1. if a is not 1 divide both sides by a, this will make x^2 1
2. isolate variable terms on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side of the equation
3. complete the square
	1. add the square of half the coefficient to x to both sides of the equation
	2. use the squar root property and solve for x

# Deriving the quadratic formula
The formula encapsulates all the methods and steps into a single formula.
$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0,\text{ }a > 0
$$

Make the coefficient of $ax^2$ to be $1$.
$$
x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a} = 0
$$

Isolate binomial by moving the constant to the other side of the equation.
$$
x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a} - \frac{c}{a} = - \frac{c}{a} \rightarrow   x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x = - \frac{c}{a}
$$

Complete the square.
$$
x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + (\frac{b}{2})^2 = - \frac{c}{a} + (\frac{b}{2})^2
$$

Finish this later for the LaTeX notes.

# The quadratic formula
The quadratic equation must be in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ to get solutions.
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt[]{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

# The discriminant
The quantity under the radicand.  The number and type of solutions is based on this number.
$$
b^2 - 4ac
$$

- $b^2 - 4ac \gt 0$ will result in **two unequal solutions**, if the radical is a perfect square the solutions will be rational, otherwise if the radical is not a perfect square then the solutions will be irrational
- $b^2 - 4ac = 0$ will result in **one solution that is a real number and repeated**
- $b^2 - 4ac \lt 0$ will result in **no real solutions but two imaginary solutions**, these are complex conjugates

# Choosing a method to solve a quadratic equation
All quadratic equations can be solved with the quadratic formula. Some methods may be faster to solve a given equation. Depends on the equations form.
