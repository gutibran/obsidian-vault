An expansion of the real number system to support when $x^2 = -1.$ Based on adding multiples of $i$ to real numbers.

$$
i = \sqrt{-1}, \text{ where } i^2 = -1
$$

$$
\sqrt{-25} = \sqrt{-1}\sqrt{25} = i\sqrt{25} = 5i
$$C
heck the result
$$
(5i)^2 = 5^2i^2 = 25(-1) = -25
$$


This is the general form.
$$
a + bi
$$
$a$ is real part, $b$ is the imaginary part. If $b \neq 0$. An imaginary number in the form of $bi$ is an imaginary number. If $b = 0$  then it is not an imaginary number.

A complex number is simplified if it in **standard form (a + bi)**. If $b$ is a radical, write $i$ before the radical

This is prevent confusion in the notation.
$$
7 + 3i\sqrt{5}
$$
## Equality of complex numbers
Real part and imaginary part have to both be equal.

$$
a + bi = c + di
$$

# Operations with complex numbers
Treat complex numbers like a binomial. Remember that $i^2 = -1$.

1. group the real and imaginary parts
2. perform the addition or subtraction, the result is the complex number

For multiplication. Treat it the same way as polynomial multiplication. Use the distributive property and FOIL method. Afterwards replace any instance of $i^2$ with -1.

# Complex conjugates and division
Get complex numbers out of the denominator to form a real number. Multiply by the inverse version of the expression, changing the operator. Same concept as before in the prerequisites section.

$$
(a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 + b^2
$$
$$
 (a - bi)(a + bi)= a^2 + b^2
$$

# Roots of negative numbers
These will both get the same result. $-a$ will have two square roots $ai$ and $-ai$, these are known as the **principle square root**.
$$
(ai)^2 = a^2i^2 = a^2(-1) = -a^2
$$
$$
(-ai)^2 = a^2 i^2 = a^2(-1) =  -a^2
$$
$$
\sqrt{-b} = i\sqrt{b}
$$

When performing operations of square roots of negative numbers, begin by expressing all square roots in terms of $i$.
