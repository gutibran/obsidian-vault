# Square Roots
Finding the square root is the **reverse operation of squaring a number**. What number when multiplied by itself results in the square, this is the square root.

$b$ is the square root of $a$.
$$
b^2 = a
$$

The **principle or nonnegative square root** uses the $\sqrt{}$ symbol. This is symbol is called the **radical sign**. The number underneath it is the **radicand**. All together it is called a **radical expression**.

**Perfect square** is a number that is the square of a rational number. 

If a negative is inside the radicand the square root is not a negative number, generally speaking.

$$
(\sqrt{2}) ^ 2 = 2
$$

This makes sense because the square root of 2 times 2 is 2.

A square root is simplified when its radicand has no factors other than 1 that are perfect squares.


# Simplifying expressions in the form of $\sqrt{a^2}$
If you apply the exponent to the base the square root will be $a$.
$$
\sqrt{a^2} = |a| 
$$

# The product rule for square roots
The rule for multiplying square roots. When $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative real numbers.
$$
\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b}
$$

$$
\sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{ab}  
$$

# The quotient rule for square roots
This works when $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative real numbers and $b \neq 0$.
$$
\sqrt{
	\frac{a}{b}
}
= 
\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}
$$

$$

\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}

=

\sqrt{
	\frac{a}{b}
}
$$

# Adding and subtracting square roots

Square roots can be combined (thorugh addition and subtraction) as long as they have the same radicand (**like radicands**). This is done through the distributive property.

$$
m\sqrt{a} + n\sqrt{a} = (m + n)\sqrt{a}
$$

# Rationalizing denominators

 Rewriting a radical expression as an equivalent expression in which the denominator no longer contains any radicals. The whole point is to make the fraction (number) rational.

If the denominator consists of a square root of a natural number that is not a perfect square, multiply the numerator and denominator by the smallest number that produces the square root of a perfect square in a denominator.

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{9}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}
$$

This works because you are technically multiplying by one which means the value does not change.

Multiply by the smallest square that will result in a perfect square.

## Conjugates
Radical expressions that involve the sum and difference of the same two terms are called conjugates.

$$

\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} \text{ and } \sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b}
$$

These are used to rationalize denominators because the product will contain no radicals.

Distribute to do the work.
$$
\sqrt{a}(\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b}) + \sqrt{b}(\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b})
$$

$$
(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b})(\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b}) = (\sqrt{a})^2 - (\sqrt{b})^2 = a -b
$$

If there are two terms with one ore more square roots, the idea is the same. 

# Other kinds of roots (nth roots)
Same idea as squares but instead of 2 it is n. Which number multiplied by itself $n$ times will give $a$. The little $n$ is called the index of the radical, by default it is 2 for square roots. If the index is even then $a$ is a nonnegative number and b is also nonnegative. If $n$ is odd then a and b can be any real numbers.

It is a good idea to become familiar with commonly used nth roots.
$$
\sqrt[n]{a} = b^n = a
$$


A number that is the nth power of a rational number is called a perfect nth power.

$$
\text{if n is odd } \sqrt[n]{a^n} = a
$$

$$
\text{if n is even} \sqrt[n]{a^n} = |a|
$$
# The product and quotient rules for nth roots
Works pretty much the same as the product and quotient rules for square root. The radicands must share the same index.
$$
\sqrt[n]{ab} = \sqrt[n]{a} \cdot \sqrt[n]{b}
$$

$$
\sqrt[n]{a} \cdot \sqrt[n]{b} = \sqrt[n]{ab}
$$


$$
\frac{\sqrt[n]{a}}{\sqrt[n]{b}} = \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}
$$ $$

\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt[n]{a}}{\sqrt[n]{b}}
$$

# Rational Exponents
This is when a base is raised to fractional power, known as a rational exponent. Rational exponents are defined so that their properties are the same as properties for integers of exponents.

When $\sqrt[n]{a}$ represents a real number, where $n \geq 2$ is an integer then.

This is the rule for when the numerator is 1.

$$
a^{\frac{1}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a}
$$

$$
a^{-\frac{1}{n}} = \frac{1}{a^{\frac{1}{n}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt[n]{a}}, \text{ } \neq 0
$$

This is the rule for when the numerator is greater than 1.

When $\sqrt[n]{a}$ represents a real number and $\frac{m}{n}$ is a positive number, $n \geq 2$ then the rule is as follows.

Numerator is the exponent and the denominator is the radicands index. It is preferable to use the first "form" because the numbers will be smaller making them easier to work with.

$$
a^{\frac{m}{n}} = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m 
$$

$$
a^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a^m}
$$

$$
a^{-\frac{m}{n}} = \frac{1}{a^{\frac{m}{n}}}
$$

## Reducing the index of a radical expression
Play around with the form of the radical to reduce the index. This makes it easier to work with, obviously, ha. Reversing the form.

$$
\sqrt[9]{x^3} = x^{\frac{3}{9}} = x^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{x}
$$
