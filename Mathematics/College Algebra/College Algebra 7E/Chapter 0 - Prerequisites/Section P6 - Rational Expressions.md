A **rational expression is a quotient of two polynomials**. The **domain** is the set of real numbers that the algebraice expression is defined in.

The main idea is to get rid of the numbers that would cause a division by 0, since division by 0 is undefined. Exclude these numbers from the algerbraic expression's domain.

# Excluding numbers from the domain
Depending on how the denominator is, you may have to factor a polynomial to figure out what the values would be.

$$
\frac{x}{x^2 - 1} = \frac{x}{(x+1)(x-1)} \therefore x \neq -1, 1
$$
# Simplifying rational expressions
These expressions consist of polynomials so a rational expression is simplified when the numerator polynomial and denominator polynomial have no common factors other than 1 or -1.

1. factor the numerator and denominator completely
2. divide both the numerator and denominator by any common factors

# Multiplying rational expressions
The product of two rational expressions is the product of their numerators divided by the product of their denominators.

1. factor the numerator and denominator
2. divide numerators and denominators by common factors
3. multiply the remaining factors in the numerator and multiply the remaining factors in the denominator

# Dividing rational expressions
The product of the first expression and the multiplicative inverse (reciprocal) of the second expression. 
- Will add example and clean up / articulate notes later on this weekend. Got to keep moving forward.

# Adding and subtracting rational expressions with the same denominator

1. adding or subtracting the numerators
2. placing the result over the common denominator
3. simplifying if possible

The fundamental rules are the same as basic fractions.
If there is a negative sign, distribute the negative to the factors in the numerator.


# Adding and subtracting rational expressions with different denominators

## Finding the LCD (least common denominator)

1.  Factor each denominator completely
2. List the factors of the first denominator
3. Add to the list in step 2 any factors of the second denominator that do not appear in the list
4. Form the product of each different factor from the list in step 3. This yields the **LCD (least common denominator)**


It is possible to just multiply as given and get a common denominator, using the LCD will result in less work. Try this out later for understanding.

1. find the lcd of the rational expressions
2. rewrite the rational experssions as an equivalent expression whose denominator is the lcd. Multiply the numerator and denominator of each rational expression by any factors needed to convert the denominator to the lcd.
3. add or subtract numerators, placing the resulting expression over the lcd
4. simplify the resulting expression

For adding and substacting the process is the same.

# Complex rational expressions (complex fractions)
These are also known as complex fractions. The numerators and or denominators containing one ore rational expressions. 

One method for simplifying is to combine the numerator into a single expression and combine its denominator into a single expression. Then perform division by inverting the denominator and multiplying.

The main idea is to get the rational expressions in the numerator and denominator to be a single expression then perform the division which will yield the answer.

The second method is to find the lcd of all the rational expressions in both the numerator and denominator. Then multiply each term in its numerator and denominator by the lcd.

The book lists another method but I am starting to mentally fatigue and I need to work on other topics and their respective exercises so I will postpone learning it for later
