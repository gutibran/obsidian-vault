A **Polynomial** is a single term or sum of two or more terms containing variables with whole-number exponents.

# How polynomials are described
Polynomials are written in **standard form** which means terms are descending in powers of the variable (greatest to least).

Each term in the polynomial is written in the form $ax^{n}$. If $a \neq 0$, the degree of $ax^{n}$ is $n$. When there is a variable that is not raised to an exponent it assumed to be 1. When there is variable next to a constant it assumed that the variable is raised to 0.

Polynomials are simplified when there are no grouping symbols and no like terms.

The term to describe simplified polynomials are **Monomials** contain 1 term. **Binomials** contain 2 terms. **Trinomials** contain 3 terms. A polynomial with more than 3 terms has no special name and is referred to as a polynomial.

The **degree** of a polynomial is the largest exponent among all the terms.

The definition of a polynomial. $a_n$ is read as "$a$ sub $n$", these are called subscripts which are used to distinguish one constant from another when a large and undetermined number of such constants are needed. Each constant is a real number, $a_n \neq 0$ and $n$ is a nonnegative integer. The polynomial is of degree $n$, $a_n$ is the **leading coefficient**, and $a_0$ is the **leading constant**.
$$
a_nx^{n} + a_nx^{n-1} + a_nx^{n-2} + a_nx^{n-3} + \ldots + a_1x + a_0

# Adding and subtracting polynomials
This done through combining like terms. Same concept as before. It is possible to add and subtract polynomials vertically.

# Multiplying polynomials
This is done through properties of exponents. The distributive property can be used to multiply a monomial and a polynomaisl that is not a monomial. If there is more than one term in the first polynomial operand, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied to every other term in the second polynomial. Trim the fat and boost understanding.

Can also multiply vertically. Never done this before so it is slightly confusing.

# Using FOIL (first, outer, inner, last) for the product of two binomials
This is distributing one term to every other term in the other polynomial.
1. first terms
2. outside terms
3. inner terms
4. last terms of both binomials

# Multiplying the sum and difference of two terms
These are all **special product formulas**. They occur frequently so it is beneficial to memorize them. They all boil down to polynomial multiplication, so if you do not memorize the formulas it may take slightly longer but you will get the same result.

## The product of the sum and difference of two terms
There is a **special product formula** to multiply $(A + B)(A - B)$. This is a quick rule and is very useful. It will always give that result. When distributing the two middle terms are inverses of each other so they cancel out. 

$$
(A + B)(A - B) = A^{2} - AB + AB - B^{2} = A^{2} - B^{2}
$$
$$
(A + B)(A - B) = A^2 - B^2
$$

## The square of a binomial sum
This is also a **special product formula**. Another quick rule.
$$
(A + B)^{2} = (A+B)(A+B) = A \cdot A + A \cdot B + 
A \cdot B + B \cdot B = A^{2} + 2AB + B^{2}
$$
$$
(A+B)^{2} = A^{2} + 2AB + B^{2}
$$

## The square of a binomial difference
This is also a **special product formula**. Another quick rule.
$$
(A-B)^2 = (A-B)(A-B) = A^2 - AB - AB -B^2 = A^2 - 2AB - B^2
$$

$$
(A-B)^2 = A^2 - 2AB + B^2
$$

## The cube of a binomial sum
This is also a **special product formula**. Another quick rule.
$$
(A+B)^{3} = A^3 + 3A^2B + 3AB^2 + B^3
$$

## The cube of a binomial difference
This is also a **special product formula**. Another quick rule.
$$
(A-B)^{3} = A^3 - 3A^2B + 3AB^2 - B^3
$$

# Polynomials in several variables
This just means that each term has more than one variable. The two variables are $x$ and $y$. The polynomial contains the sum of one or more monomials in the form of $ax^ny^m$. $a$ is the coefficient. The exponents $m$ and $n$ are whole numbers. The degree of the a term is the sum of $n$ and $m$. The degree of the polynomial is the greatest degree sum of all the terms.
