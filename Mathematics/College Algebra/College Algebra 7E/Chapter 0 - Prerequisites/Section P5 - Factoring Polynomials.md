Factoring a polynomial expressed as the sum of monomials means finding an equivalent expression that is a product. Going the reverse direction. **Factoring over the set of integers** means that coefficients in the factors are integers. Polynomials that cannot be factored using integers coefficients are called **irreducible over the integers** or **prime**.

The main idea is to use one or more factoring techniques until each of the polynomial's factors are prime or irreducible. Sometimes there may be a monomial factor that cannot be factored further. When this is achieved, the polynomial is said to be **factored completely**.

# Common factors
The first step of factoring, in general is to find the **GCF (greatest common factor)**. In the context of polynomials this is an expression of the highest degree that divides each term of the polynomial. The distributive property in reverse.

$$
ab + ac = a(b + c)
$$

The variable part of the GCF always contains the smallest power of a variable or algebraic expression that appears in all terms of the polynomial. Take the GCF for the coefficient and each variable.

# Factoring by grouping
When all the terms only share a factor of 1. Group together factors that do share a factor. Check if the factoring is correct by multiplying back into the original form.

# Factoring trinomials
These are the steps for factoring a trinomial in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$. **Memorize the steps for this process**.
1. Find two terms whose product is $ax^2$, these two values will go in the first spot in the parentheses.
2. Find two terms whose product is $c$, these two values go in the second spot in the parentheses. Find all possible values.
3. Through brute-force perform steps 1 and 2 until the sum outside product and inside product is $bx$. If no combination exists then the polynomial is prime. Test the possible values.

When $c$ is positive, find two numbers with the same sign as the middle term. This will help eliminate options in step 3. The sign between $ax^2$ and $bx$. 
For example $x^2 + 6x$ will result in the signs of the factors both being positive. The inverse is true, for example $x^2 - 6x$ will result in the signs of the factors both being negative.

When $c$ is negative, find two numbers with opposite signs whose sum is the coefficient of the middle term. The sign between $bx$ and $c$. For example $3x - 18$ will result in opposite signs in the order ($+$, $-$). 

These are both based on the signage of $c$.
