Factoring a polynomial expressed as the sum of monomials means finding an equivalent expression that is a product. Going the reverse direction. **Factoring over the set of integers** means that coefficients in the factors are integers. Polynomials that cannot be factored using integers coefficients are called **irreducible over the integers** or **prime**.

The main idea is to use one or more factoring techniques until each of the polynomial's factors are prime or irreducible. Sometimes there may be a monomial factor that cannot be factored further. When this is achieved, the polynomial is said to be **factored completely**.

# Common factors
The first step of factoring, in general is to find the **GCF (greatest common factor)**. In the context of polynomials this is an expression of the highest degree that divides each term of the polynomial. The distributive property in reverse.

$$
ab + ac = a(b + c)
$$

The variable part of the GCF always contains the smallest power of a variable or algebraic expression that appears in all terms of the polynomial. Take the GCF for the coefficient and each variable.

# Factoring by grouping
When all the terms only share a factor of 1. Group together factors that do share a factor. Check if the factoring is correct by multiplying back into the original form.

# Factoring trinomials
These are the steps for factoring a trinomial in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$. **Memorize the steps for this process**.
1. Find two terms whose product is $ax^2$, these two values will go in the first spot in the parentheses.
2. Find two terms whose product is $c$, these two values go in the second spot in the parentheses. Find all possible values.
3. Through brute-force perform steps 1 and 2 until the sum outside product and inside product is $bx$. If no combination exists then the polynomial is prime. Test the possible values.

When $c$ is positive, find two numbers with the same sign as the middle term. This will help eliminate options in step 3. The sign between $ax^2$ and $bx$. 
For example $x^2 + 6x$ will result in the signs of the factors both being positive. The inverse is true, for example $x^2 - 6x$ will result in the signs of the factors both being negative.

When $c$ is negative, find two numbers with opposite signs whose sum is the coefficient of the middle term. The sign between $bx$ and $c$. For example $3x - 18$ will result in opposite signs in the order ($+$, $-$). 

These are both based on the signage of $c$.

These steps work when the leading coefficient is greater than or equal to 1. The steps also apply to trinomials in two variables.

# Factoring the difference of two squares
This is the **reversal of the special product for the sum and difference of two terms.** 
$$
A^2-B^2= (A+B)(A+B)
$$

## Repeated factorization
This checking if there are any terms that can be factored further. It is beneficial to know the properties of exponents to "catch" these. Look for special products.
$$
x^4 - 81
$$

$$
(x^2 -9)(x^2+9)
$$
$(x^2-9)$ is a special product so it can be factored further which results in this.

$$
(x^2+9)(x+3)(x-3)
$$

# Factoring perfect square trinomials
This is the **reversal of the special product for squaring binomials**. Remember that the signage of the factored expression is determined by the operator between the first and second operands. In the example below between $A^2$ and $2AB$.
$$
A^2 + 2AB + B^2 = (A+B)^2
$$
$$
A^2-2AB+B^2=(A-B)^2
$$

# Factoring the sum or difference of two cubes
Same concept but for the cubes. This is the **reversal of the special product for the sum or difference of cubes**.
$$
A^3 + B^3 = (A+B)(A^2-AB+B^2)
$$
$$
A^3-B^3=(A-B)(A^2+AB+B^2)
$$

The acronym **SOAP** is useful for remembering the form.
- **S**ame signs refers to the binomial signage is the same as the cubed binomial
- **O**pposite signs refers to the signage between the first and second operand in the triomial which is different from the binomial factor
- **A**lways positive refers to the signage between the second and third operands in the trinomial

So my question is how do Derive these process mathematically. I know that the processes exist and always work but why? I know the processes are memorized.

**Memorize the special forms forward and backwards for factoring aspect of the test**
# The general strategy for factoring polynomials
The order of the factors does not matter because of the commutative property.

1. If there is a common factor, factor out the GCF
2. Based on the number of terms in the polynomial try a method.
	- if there are two terms try a special form
		- difference of two squares
		- sum of two cubes
		- difference of two cubes
	- if there are three terms, check if it is a perfect square trinomial and use one of the special forms, otherwise brute force the regular method
	- if there are four or more terms try factoring by grouping
3. check if more than one term can be factored further
