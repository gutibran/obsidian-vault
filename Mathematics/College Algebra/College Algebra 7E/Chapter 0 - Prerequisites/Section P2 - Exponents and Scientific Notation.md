Exponents represent repeated multiplication.

# The product rule
Multiplying factors n factors of the base by m factors of the base. This is why you can you add over the values of the exponent as long as they share the exact same base.
$$
b^n \cdot b^m = (b \cdot b \cdot b \ldots) \cdot (b \cdot b \ldots) = b^{m + n}
$$

# The quotient rule
Divide m factors of b by n factors of b. this is why you can subtract the values of the exponents as long as they share the same base. The factors that get canceled out are equal to 1 which is why they get canceled out. Whatever is left over is the quotient.
$$
	\frac{b^{m}}{b^{n}} = b^{m - n}, b \neq 0
$$
# Zero as an exponent
This is when a base is raised to 0. This rule is derived from the logic of the quotient rule.
$$
	\frac{b^{m}}{b^{m}} = 1 \rightarrow  b^{m - m} = b^{0} = 1
$$

$$
b^0 = 1
$$

# Negative integers as exponents
A nonzero base raised to a negative power. The logic is also derived from the quotient rule.

What happens to the numerator when there are no factors left, when they all get canceled out, there will remain a one.
$$
\frac{b^3}{b^5} = \frac{b \cdot b \cdot b}{b \cdot b \cdot b \cdot b \cdot b} = \frac{1}{b^2}
$$$$
b^{3-5} = b^{-2}
$$
These must mean the same thing then.
$$
b^{-2} = \frac{1}{b^2}
$$

This is the general rule.
$$
b^{-n} = \frac{1}{b^n}
$$ 

Same idea but automates getting the denominator out. Will demonstrate the math later.
$$
\frac{1}{b^{-n}} = b^n
$$

# The power rule (powers to powers)
When an exponential expression is raised to a power. Multiplies the base's exponent m,  n times.
$$
(b^m)^n = b^{mn}
$$

# Product to powers rule

When a product is raised to a power.
$$
(ab)^{n} = a^nb^n
$$

# Quotient to power rule
Raise a quotient to a power. Works as long as b is a nonzero real number.
$$
(\frac{a}{b})^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}
$$
# The general strategy for simplifying exponential expressions
This is the criteria for simplification. Use the properties above to simplify completely.
- no parentheses
- no powers are raised to other powers
- each base occurs only once
- no negative or zero exponents appear

# Using scientific notation
A shorthand for writing really large or really small numbers.

$$
 a \times 10^n
$$

Remember that the absolute value of $a$ is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. Also $n$ is an integer.

$$
1 \leq |a| \lt 10
$$

Positive integer raising 10 means move decimal to the right n times. Negative integers power means to move the decimal to the left n times.

Converting from and to uses the same idea.

Exponential properties apply here to perform arithmetic operations (computations) with numbers in scientific notation.

Read up on this later.
