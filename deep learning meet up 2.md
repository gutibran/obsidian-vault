- MNIST
- Tensorflow
- Keras is used to build the models
- have to turn the data into a vector, this is mandatory
- CIFAR10,
- check out keras datasets libraries
- normalize data
- rectified linear unit -> make points linear by rectifying (changing)the negative numbers to zero
- all nodes have to sum up to one, since the model deals with probabilities
- how to train a nerual network with mnist library and tensorflwo
